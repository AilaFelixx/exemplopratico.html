# exemplopratico.html
 
I want to use this README to make one thing clear: I used an existing recipe website named 'TudoGostoso.' The description of the recipes is just an example. I did this because I didn't want to lose too much time building the website from scratch; I just wanted to practice my HTML and CSS skills. Doing this optimized my time.
And one more thing I need to clarify: I don't have plans to post this project or anything. It was just to practice the skills I've learned in the classes.
 
 So, Iâ€™m leaving here the page I used in my project: "https://www.tudogostoso.com.br/noticias/cultura-brasileira-a-mesa-20-pratos-tipicos-do-brasil-para-se-deliciar-a7578.htm".
 
 I also used some social media icons in the footer, and I leaving here the credits too: "https://www.flaticon.com/br/icones-gratis/rede-social" Social media icons were made by riajulislam.

 That's it :)
